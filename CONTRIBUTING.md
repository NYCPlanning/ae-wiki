# Welcome to the AE Wiki Contributing Guide
This wiki belongs to all members of the Application Engineering team and all members are encouraged to make contributions. This document lays out the process and guidelines that all team members are expected to follow when making contributions. A shared understanding of how to contribute to this wiki helps to ensure it stays usable, useful, and actually used.

## What should or shouldn't go in the wiki?
The wiki should focus on documentation that would not be better served living elsewhere. Here are some examples of things that should not go in this wiki:
* Documentation that is relevant to other teams in addition to ours, such as non-technical product documentation like user research and personas
* Repo-specific documentation - this should live in the repo it pertains too. This includes documentation about how to perform deployments or data updates for particular applications
* Documentation for processes that exist "above" Application Engineering that are already documented at the GDE or Agency level. However, including *links* to that documentation here is welcome such that this wiki can serve as a "starting point" for team members.
* Meeting notes or minutes - this wiki should no be a place to document outcomes or takeaways from specific meetings. However, documenting standing agendas for recurring meetings and ceremonies is welcome

Things that are a good fit for this wiki might include:
* Internal AE SOPs that are not specific to any one product or repository
* Code styling rules and best practices that may not be feasible to automate with checks and linters
* Our hiring process
* Team member onboarding and offboarding guides
* Team collaboration norms and guidelines, such as best practices for version control while collaborating with another engineer

## Consider using Issues or Discussions
If you have an idea for a contribution but aren't sure how to make it yourself, consider creating an Issue or Discussion in this repo. An Issue can be a good place to capture something you think is missing. Discussions can be a good place to get input from other team members on an idea you need help forming.

## Getting started
To make a contribution follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Create a branch off of `main` with a descriptive branch name
3. Add your contribution to this branch, committing code with descriptive commit messages as you go
4. Push your branch to this repo
5. Open a pull request against `main` and request a review from the `Application Engineering` team in Github. Your pull request description should explain the contents and reasoning for your changes
6. Once your changes have been approved by two team members, and all conversations from all reviewers are resolved, you may merge your branch
7. Pat yourself on the back for contributing to your team's wiki :D

### Contribution formatting
All contributions should be in the form of markdown files. If your contribution doesn't fit into any of the section folders at the root of this repo, create one! Others can share their thoughts on how you organize your contribution during PR review.
