# Welcome to the Application Engineering Wiki!

Application Engineering (AE) is a team within the Geographic Data and Engineering group at the New York City Department of City Planning. We build and maintain a family of digital products like [Zola](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov), [Population FactFinder](https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov), and the [Equitable Development Data Explorer](https://equitableexplorer.planning.nyc.gov). To learn more about how we work, check out our [mission statement](1-about/mission-statement.md).

This wiki is a place for AE team members to document general processes, best practices, and guidelines for how we work. If you're a member of the team and would like to contribute, start by thoroughly reading [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
