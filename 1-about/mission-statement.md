# Our mission

The mission of the Application Engineering team is to build digital products that deliver on DCP's commitments to its partners, other agencies, and the public. Our products:
* Help the agency to perform vital functions
* Lower the barrier to entry for accessing and understanding open data
* Educate the public about NYC's zoning, demographics, and built environment
* Build trust by enabling two-way engagement with the public

# Our Approach

We implement user-centered design to build with, not for, our users. We build products that are accessible and seek input from a diverse group of current and potential users. Our products are rooted in clear problem statements with measurable goals and outcomes. We use qualitative and quantitative metrics to build iteratively, adjusting our products to meet complex and ever-changing user needs. We show transparency by sharing our work with the open source community and publicly documenting our design decisions.
